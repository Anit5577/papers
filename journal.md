#Title
Using N-body simulations with different initial conditions to find Runaways in Young Star Clusters

#Introduction
Stars are born in cluster and simulations of these clusters can be used to 
constrain the initial conditions (Lada & Lada 2003).

Lada & Lada (2003) claim that 70-90% of all stars are born in a clustered environment.

#Methods
There is method to my madness and I am making all of this up as I go along.
